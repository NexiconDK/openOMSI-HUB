# Bus Company Online

Bus Company as it is today, but online. One big server - NexiconDK's own machine, always on -
runs two kinds of program. The **main server** holds every company of every map: their depots,
money, buses, staff, rosters, tenders, and the players; it runs their days on its own clock, 1:1
with the real one, whether anybody is logged in or not, and loads no map. A **world per map** -
the dedicated server as it is, without a window or graphics - runs a map for everybody who drives
there, as a LAN session: the traffic, the passengers and every company's buses in their paint, on
the main server's clock; the main server starts a map's world when the first player wants to
drive there and closes it a while after the last has gone. The plan in Danish, with pictures,
for the team: "Bus Company Multiplayer - plan" (udkast 4, 24 October 2026; udkast 2 had one
company on a dedicated server - a misunderstanding; udkast 3 let each player's computer run its
own world - then the AI buses and the traffic are not the same for everybody).

## Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| The server | One big server (our own machine), always on: the main server with all the data, and a world per map in use. No other servers in this mode |
| The world | One per map, run by the server (the dedicated server: traffic, passengers, every company's AI buses), started when the first player wants to drive on the map, closed a while after the last has gone; no world: the AI trips worked out at midnight |
| Seeing each other | Everybody on a map is in the same world, as in LAN: the same buses, cars and passengers |
| Time | Real time 1:1, around the clock; the day closes at midnight; the time the server was off is caught up |
| Companies | Founded by players on the server, with enough of their own pay (and courses - which, decided later) |
| Maps | A company is founded on one map and never changes it; each of its depots belongs to its map for good |
| Local depots | A company that does well opens local depots on other maps, the same way it was founded; each has a manager (depot leader), its own cash and books, buses, staff, timetables and rosters |
| The head company | Opens and closes depots, appoints the managers, moves money between depots, approves big purchases (new buses), sets the company's name, colours, logo and share; sees all depots together |
| Between depots | Buses can be moved from depot to depot, staff lent - within one company only |
| Lines | On each map a line belongs to at most one company, won by tender; the map's lines no company has run as the map has them |
| The roster | The easy mode's routine fills it; in Normal and Realistic the planners alone, what they leave open does not run |
| Trips | A map's world reports every trip once, the AI buses' and the players' (measured by the server, not by the player's game); a map without a world: the main server works its AI trips out at midnight, as Bus Company does for the days not played |
| Control room | Per depot: every bus live while the map's world runs (interventions on the AI buses), else where the timetable has them |
| Identity | The Steam ID read on the player's computer (`Steam/config/loginusers.vdf`) and a secret key the server gives that computer |
| Pay | A trip counts in the company's books (the depot's) and in the player's own career; the company takes a share of the trip's income it chooses (say 25 %), a change counting from the next day |
| Project | A server program of its own built from Omsi-Hub's code, in modules of its own, behind a switch (off until ready); no new fork, no long-lived branch |

## Phases

1. **The big server**: the main server - every company and depot on every map, on the server's
   clock; days closed at midnight, saved, caught up after a pause; and a world per map - the
   dedicated server with every company's buses in their paint on the server's clock, started and
   closed by the main server, its trips reported to it; no world: the AI trips worked out at
   midnight. Measured: what a world costs in memory and CPU, how long it takes to start.
2. **Log in and the company's pages**: "Bus Company Online" in the launcher, Steam ID and key; the
   company's pages as today, with the server's data; found a company on a map from one's own pay;
   roles and permissions; other players hired.
3. **Drive**: Drive joins the duty's map's world on the server with the duty's bus (the world
   started first if it is not running); the AI bus taken off the tour; the trips measured by the
   world (the depot's share, the driver's pay); everybody on the map in one world.
4. **Depots**: a local depot on another map; depot leaders; money and buses moved, staff lent;
   the head office's view and approvals.
5. **Competition and control room**: tenders between the players' companies on each map; a
   control room per depot.
6. **Polish**: courses required to found a company; maps kept running if the machine can carry
   them; translations and guides.

## What is built (phase 1)

**The main server**: `omsi-hub-cli --company-server <folder>` (`company::main_server`), no window,
no map, no graphics. `<folder>/company-server.cfg` (written with the defaults the first time): the
OMSI folder (`root`), the server's clock (`real_time`, or `date` and `time` the first time), the
worlds' game program, ports, how many at once and their idle minutes, and what they run.

- The server's clock (`online::ServerClock`, `server_clock`, `<folder>/clock.json`): set the first
  time, then 1:1 with the real clock, on where it was after a restart (the time it was off
  included); on the real time it takes the machine's date and time at each start, forward only.
- Every company of `<folder>/companies` on every installed map runs on it (`online::Host`, its
  course pinned to the clock; its map's folder from `root`, a mod's copy first): a step every
  `STEP` (2 s), the folder looked through every `SCAN` (30 s) for companies founded since, every
  company saved at `quit`. One main server per folder (`online::lock_folder`, `server.lock`).
- Whenever a plan is written, a company comes on or the clock is set, the worlds are told
  (`online::bump_plans`, `plans.gen`).
- The console: `help`, `status`, `start <map>`, `stop <map>`, `found <name>; <map>; [mode]`
  (`online::found_on_server`: on the server's date and minute), `testcopy <id>` (for a test until
  phase 2: a copy of one of the machine's launcher companies, moved to the server's date without
  simulating between: `online::copy_to_server`), `quit`. Its log: `<folder>/company-server.log`.

**A map's world**: `start <map>` writes `<folder>/worlds/<map>/server.cfg` (`main_server::world_cfg`)
and starts `omsi-hub-game --server` with it on the next free ports (UDP `first_port + 2k`, web
`+1`); its output goes to `world.out` beside it. With `companies = 1` the dedicated server is a
world (`omsi-app` `company_server`): it runs on the main server's clock
(`online::read_server_clock`), takes every company with a plan of its map
(`company_live::ServerCompanies`: each line to one company, its tours with its buses in its paint,
its lines' other tours kept off, the map's other lines as ever), takes the plans and the clock in
again when `plans.gen` changes (`ScheduleSim::reload_company`), and reports every company trip
into the folder once (`store::append_live`), which the main server's host tells its company.
`idle_stop` (minutes): the world stops by itself that long after its last player; the main server
lets it go (`reap_worlds`).

Tested: `company::online::tests`, `company::main_server::tests` (companies on two maps, founded and
copied from the console, restarted), `company_live::tests`, `company_server::tests`,
`server::idle_tests`, `server_cfg::tests`. Not run yet on a real server with a real map.

Still to do in phase 1: measured on a real map (a world's memory and CPU, how long it takes to
start); what the launcher's pages do besides (a line's change on its day, the dealer's
deliveries, the control room's messages, the depot's building) moved to the hosts.

### Measured on a real map (Ahlheim: 30 lines, 418 tours a day)

`OMSI_COMPANY_MAP_DIR=<map folder> cargo test -p omsi-launcher-core --lib online::tests::on_a_real_map -- --ignored --nocapture`,
a company of 3 lines (74 tours a day), 18 buses, 150 staff:

| Step | Time |
|---|---|
| The map's timetable of a day read | 0.65 s (5.8 s the first time, from a cold disk) |
| Opened (caught up, day entered, planned, saved) | 0.73 s |
| A step a minute | 1.9 ms |
| On through midnight (the next day's timetable read, the day closed, planned, saved) | 1.1 s |
| The company's file | 444 KB |

A midnight costs a company about a second: the companies run on a thread of their own, never on
anything that answers the players.

## Open questions (udkast 4)

The maps to start with; the price of a company and of a depot; whether moving a bus between maps
costs money or time; who pays a lent employee; the limit of a big purchase; the company's share
(a cap, a default); bankruptcy of a depot or the whole company; how often lines go to tender and
how bids are judged; leaving a duty halfway; working for several companies; who may join the
server.
